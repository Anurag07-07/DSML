Cars are mobile machines that have transformed societies by combining engineering, design, and culture into a single, ubiquitous technology: from the earliest horseless carriages to today’s high-tech models, they serve as personal transportation, status symbols, and economic engines. Modern cars integrate complex systems—internal combustion or electric powertrains, advanced safety features like airbags and electronic stability control, digital infotainment, and increasingly sophisticated driver-assistance and autonomous driving functions—while manufacturers balance performance, fuel efficiency, emissions, and cost. Design choices reflect diverse needs: compact city cars prioritize maneuverability and economy, SUVs emphasize space and capability, and performance cars focus o
